# To-Do List

This project is a part of The Odin Project's advanced JavaScript curriculum. It’s a web application designed to manage tasks across different projects, allowing users to create, save, and organize to-do items in custom or default categories. It uses **local storage** for data persistence, ensuring tasks remain available even after refreshing the page.

## Key Features
- **Task Creation and Organization**: Easily add and save to-do items in various projects.
- **Persistent Data**: Local storage ensures your tasks are saved and remain accessible across sessions.
- **Project Organization**: Sort tasks into custom or default projects for better organization.

## Project Goals
The primary objective was to write clean, organized, and maintainable code by leveraging the following principles:
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organize code into ES6 Modules for better readability and maintainability.
- **IIFEs, Classes, and Prototypal Inheritance**: Utilize JavaScript features for efficient code structure.
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply principles of clean code:
  - **Single Responsibility**: Each component or class has a specific, focused responsibility.
  - **Open/Closed**: Components are open to extension but closed to modification.
  - **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes or modules can replace their base counterparts.
  - **Interface Segregation**: Avoid imposing unnecessary methods on classes.
  - **Dependency Inversion**: Rely on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

## What I Learned
This project offered practical experience with:
- **Planning and Organizing Code**: Outlining structure before diving into code helped with organization.
- **SOLID Principles**: Understanding and implementing these principles for cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Classes and ES6 Modules**: Utilizing classes for object-oriented structure and ES6 modules for code organization.
- **Factory Functions**: Creating reusable components through factory functions.
- **Prototypal Inheritance**: Leveraging JavaScript’s prototype-based inheritance for efficient object manipulation.
- **Local Storage for Data Persistence**: Learning basic data persistence methods to keep user data intact.
